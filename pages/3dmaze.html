      <h2>3D Maze</h2><br>
      <p>HackIllinois is a 36 hour hackathon hosted at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. During the 2016 session, my team wanted to learn something new. On the way to the hackathon I saw someone using Google Cardboard to explore virtual reality apps on an android phone. After trying for myself, I was convinced that I just had to learn how to develop a virtual reality app. I looked up some documentation online and convinced my group that it should be "easy enough". </p>

      <h2>Learning the Technology</h2><br>
      <p>Armed with a convenient Google Cardboard given to us by AT&T, we set about learning how to create a virtual reality application. We stumbled upon Unity, an open source game development engine. Using some tutorials online, we learned how to create a basic, multi-level game. The race was on to create a maze game where the player would be placed into the maze. We wanted the player to really feel like they were lost and had to find their way out.

      <h2>Then came the magic. </h2>
      <p>With a maze game that was fun enough to play with a keyboard, we then wanted to really place the player into the environment through the application of virtual reality. We found a Unity plugin for Google Cardboard that created the proper viewports for us. We simply had to create some scripts for walking, object collision, and other game logic. With some fine tuning of parameters, we had a Virtual Reality application. While not the most useful application at the hackathon, our demo table was full of people who wanted to experience virtual reality.
